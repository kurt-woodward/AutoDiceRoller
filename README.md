# AutoDiceRoller
In this project I intend to explore the Software Development Lifecycle through building a small, RaspberyyPi-controlled device to automatically roll dice, recognize the displayed face, and calculate the fairness of the device over repeated trials.  
The backend was developed using C#, T-SQL, Python, and Postman for API development, while the frontend used Visual Studio scaffolding for HTML/CSS via Bootstrap. There is still a lot of room to explore and incrementally improve both the hardware and software as I gain proficiency with each of the components.
