# AutoDiceRoller
In this project I intend to explore the Software Development Lifecycle through building a small, RaspberyyPi-controlled device to automatically roll dice, recognize the displayed face, and calculate the fairness of the device over repeated trials.  
The backend was developed using C#, T-SQL, Python, and Postman for API development, while the frontend used Visual Studio scaffolding for HTML/CSS via Bootstrap. There is still a lot of room to explore and incrementally improve both the hardware and software as I gain proficiency with each of the components.

### 1. [Model Classes](https://github.com/kurt-woodward/AutoDiceRoller/tree/main/AutoDiceRoller/Models)  
#### 1a.  DiceRollerDBContext.cs
> This is the scaffolded class generated from the DiceRoller database.
#### 1a.  ErrorViewModel.cs  
> This is the default scaffolded error handler.
#### 1a.  OcrResult.cs  
> This model underlies a scaffolded form where entries can be made and modified manually. Eventually, I would like to make this accessible only via API or a future admin login.

#### 7a. Installing Ubuntu Server 20.04
> This was surprisingly simple. Ubuntu has an application that allows you to select from a number of images appropriate for various RaspberryPi models and purposes and automatically formats your installation drive.
